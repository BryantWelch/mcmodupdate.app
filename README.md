## 🎯 About The Project

This tool was built to solve two common problems for Minecraft players: the tedious process of manually updating dozens of mods, and the challenge of building a new mod list with all the correct dependencies.

MC Mod Updater provides a simple, elegant solution by allowing you to either drag-and-drop your existing `.jar` files or search for new mods directly. It then uses a powerful, hash-based search to accurately identify your mods on Modrinth and find the latest compatible versions for your chosen Minecraft version and mod loader.
